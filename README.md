# Overview

I wrote a TypeScript user registration and login system. Users can choose to register or login and depending on which one they choose they can input the data, data will be evaluated, and users will be given a pass or fail response.

I wrote this so that I could learn about TypeScript since I have never used it before and heard it was a very useful language to know.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I want to make it so that the password is displayed as asterisks
- Eventually this would be connected to a database and user passwords would be encrypted
- I also want to connect this to frontend website so it looks like a normal login screen.
